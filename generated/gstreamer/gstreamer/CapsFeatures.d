/**
 * #GstCapsFeatures can optionally be set on a #GstCaps to add requirements
 * for additional features for a specific #GstStructure. Caps structures with
 * the same name but with a non-equal set of caps features are not compatible.
 * If a pad supports multiple sets of features it has to add multiple equal
 * structures with different feature sets to the caps.
 * 
 * Empty #GstCapsFeatures are equivalent with the #GstCapsFeatures that only
 * contain #GST_CAPS_FEATURE_MEMORY_SYSTEM_MEMORY. ANY #GstCapsFeatures as
 * created by gst_caps_features_new_any() are equal to any other #GstCapsFeatures
 * and can be used to specify that any #GstCapsFeatures would be supported, e.g.
 * for elements that don't touch buffer memory. #GstCaps with ANY #GstCapsFeatures
 * are considered non-fixed and during negotiation some #GstCapsFeatures have
 * to be selected.
 * 
 * Examples for caps features would be the requirement of a specific #GstMemory
 * types or the requirement of having a specific #GstMeta on the buffer. Features
 * are given as a string of the format `memory:GstMemoryTypeName` or
 * `meta:GstMetaAPIName`.
